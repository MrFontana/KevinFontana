        BIO
        </p>
       </div>
        <p class='bio-text'>I'm a web developer living in San Diego with my beautiful wife and two sons. I have a strong passion to learn and continue furthering my abilities as a web dev.<br>

I was born and raised in Orange County, Ca where I started my career as a salesman in the tech industry. I've had a fruitful and fulfilling career because I deeply enjoyed bringing people into the world of technology with every sale.<br>

Fast forward to 2012, My wife and I had just purchased our first home, with baby #1 well on the way. I was working at Microsoft at the time as a teacher and a sales advisor when I was introduced to the beautiful and mysterious world of coding. I was fascinated by my coworkers who could essentially think up a website, create a wireframe and put fingers to keyboard before the end of the day. I wanted to be like that. I wanted to use my creativity to make beautiful, functional things. However, sales were booming and I was on top of the world, and with our first child on the way I just didn't have a good enough reason to pull the trigger and make the jump into a new career. <br>

Would you believe it?  3 years and 1 kid later, a good friend of mine went to school for coding. As I watched his journey and overwhelming success, my wife and I determined that this was it. This was the time to make the jump into my dream career. I packed up my things and went to school in Provo, Utah. <br>

I entered Utah a novice coder and left a bonafide Web Developer, enjoying full stack web development ((MEAN stack, SANE stack)) in single page applications. </p>
